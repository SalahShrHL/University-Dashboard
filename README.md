#  University Dashboard

This project is a dynamic web-based dashboard designed to help a university (Pravan University) visualize and analyze their student data.

## Description

Pravan University maintains a database named "db_university" which contains a table named "results" that holds the students' results. This dashboard provides a modern and interactive interface for the university's decision-makers to analyze the data along at least three different axes.

The dashboard is built using modern web technologies and provides an intuitive user interface for data visualization and analysis.

The project structure is divided into two main folders:
- `resources`: This folder contains all the necessary resources for the project, including the database script and an Excel version of the database for initial data exploration.
- `app`: This folder contains the application code for the dashboard.
